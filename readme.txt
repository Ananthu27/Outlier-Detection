IMPACT OF DIMENTIONALITY REDUCITON ON CLUSTERING BASED OUTLIER DETECTION
Challenges
challenges in outlier detection, including:

    Lack of Labeled Data:
        Due to the rarity of outlier instances, obtaining labeled data for training can be challenging. This poses a significant obstacle in developing robust outlier detection models.

    Identifying Outliers in Extremely Large Datasets:
        The difficulty of efficiently identifying outliers in extremely large datasets is a common obstacle. Traditional methods may be computationally expensive or impractical for datasets with a high volume of records.

    Processing Live Data:
        Handling live data introduces additional challenges, including real-time processing requirements and the need for adaptive models. This aspect is considered to ensure the practical applicability of the developed outlier detection     system.

OVERVIEW
This project implements the clustering based outlier detection technique described in the survey paper, and further applies various dimentiality reduction techniques and studies its impact on the same.
